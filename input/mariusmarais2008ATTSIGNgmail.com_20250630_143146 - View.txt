\begin{hymn}{30}{We have found him}{}
\begin{stanza}
Ye who trace with weary hearts and sad\\
Those blest scenes of Galilee,\\
O rejoice and be forever glad!\\
"We have found Him - come and see!"
\end{stanza}
\begin{chorus}
\setchorusline{We have found Him! - Joy of the Ages!}
"We have found Him! - Joy of the Ages!"\\
And our song with heaven's gladness rings:\\
"We have found the Christ of whom the prophets spake;\\
We have found Him, King of kings."
\end{chorus}
\begin{stanza}
Ye who hunger for the living word,\\
Ye who thirst for living springs,\\
Come, each waiting heart with joy is stirred\\
By the song the herald sings.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
This same Christ who taught beside the sea\\
Walks upon the earth today,\\
And He comes in lowliness to thee,\\
Templed still in mortal clay.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"We have found Him!" Bear the tidings far,\\
Wheresoever men are found,\\
Until all who seek the Guiding Star\\
Shall in light and peace abound.
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}

\begin{hymn}{40}{God's time is now}{}
\begin{stanza}
God's time is now: O do not wait\\
Until another day is born;\\
His Spirit, grieved, may take His flight\\
And leave you, never to return.
\end{stanza}
\begin{chorus}
\setchorusline{Today if you will hear His voice,}
Today if you will hear His voice,\\
Respond and harden not your heart;\\
Wait not a more convenient day:\\
His Holy Spirit may depart.
\end{chorus}
\begin{stanza}
God's time is now: O linger not;\\
The shades of night are falling fast,\\
And still you undecided stand;\\
What if today should be your last?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
God's time is now: do not rebel\\
Nor wait a more convenient day;\\
While angels bow their heads and weep,\\
You cast the Saviour's love away.
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}

\begin{hymn}{126}{Kindly entreating}{}
\begin{stanza}
Kindly entreating, "Come unto me,"\\
Jesus the Saviour is speaking to thee,\\
Earnestly saying, "Do not delay;\\
Flee from destruction, escape while you may.\\
Flee from destruction, escape while you may."
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Kindly entreating, "Come unto me:\\
Glory immortal your portion shall be."\\
Shame and dishonour wait those who stray\\
Far from the Saviour on ruin's dark way -\\
Far from the Saviour on ruin's dark way.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Kindly entreating, hear Him once more;\\
Soon you'll be stranded on sin's treacherous shore.\\
Angels are waiting; do you not care\\
That you are drifting to endless despair -\\
That you are drifting to endless despair?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Kindly entreating, "Come unto me,"\\
Aimlessly drifting on life's restless sea,\\
No hope, no refuge, where will you end?\\
Hasten to Jesus, your Saviour and Friend.\\
Hasten to Jesus, your Saviour and Friend.
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}
