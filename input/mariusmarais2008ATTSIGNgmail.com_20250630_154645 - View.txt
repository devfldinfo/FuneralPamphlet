\begin{hymn}{100}{Passing onward}{}
\begin{stanza}
Passing onward, quickly passing;\\
But, I ask thee, whither bound?\\
Is it to the many mansions\\
Where eternal rest is found?\\
Passing onward, Passing onward,\\
Tell me, sinner, whither bound?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Passing onward, quickly passing;\\
Naught the wheels of time can stay;\\
Sweet the thought that some are going\\
To the realms of perfect day,\\
Passing onward, Passing onward,\\
Christ their leader, Christ their way.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Passing onward, quickly passing;\\
Many on the downward road,\\
Careless of their soul's salvation,\\
Heeding not the call of God:\\
Passing onward, Passing onward,\\
Trampling on the Saviour's blood.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Passing onward, quickly passing;\\
Time its course will quickly run;\\
Still we hear the fond entreaty\\
Of the ever gracious One:\\
"Come, and welcome, Come, and welcome;\\
Tis by me that life is won."
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}

\begin{hymn}{30}{We have found him}{}
\begin{stanza}
Ye who trace with weary hearts and sad\\
Those blest scenes of Galilee,\\
O rejoice and be forever glad!\\
"We have found Him - come and see!"
\end{stanza}
\begin{chorus}
\setchorusline{We have found Him! - Joy of the Ages!}
"We have found Him! - Joy of the Ages!"\\
And our song with heaven's gladness rings:\\
"We have found the Christ of whom the prophets spake;\\
We have found Him, King of kings."
\end{chorus}
\begin{stanza}
Ye who hunger for the living word,\\
Ye who thirst for living springs,\\
Come, each waiting heart with joy is stirred\\
By the song the herald sings.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
This same Christ who taught beside the sea\\
Walks upon the earth today,\\
And He comes in lowliness to thee,\\
Templed still in mortal clay.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"We have found Him!" Bear the tidings far,\\
Wheresoever men are found,\\
Until all who seek the Guiding Star\\
Shall in light and peace abound.
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}

\begin{hymn}{163}{Jesus, my Saviour King}{}
\begin{stanza}
Jesus, my Saviour King,\\
I will be Thine!\\
Only to Thee I cling -\\
I will be Thine!\\
Mine not the worldling's gain,\\
Mine not his pleasures vain!\\
Man's honours I disdain -\\
I will be Thine!
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Let others seek their own -\\
I will be Thine!\\
I'll live for Thee alone -\\
I will be Thine!\\
Riches and earthly fame,\\
Each mean or selfish aim,\\
Forever I disclaim -\\
I will be Thine!
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Whate'er Thou wilt I'll do -\\
I will be Thine!\\
Gladly I'll suffer too -\\
I will be Thine!\\
Only possess my heart,\\
Bid sin and fear depart;\\
O let us never part!\\
I will be Thine!
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}

\begin{hymn}{42}{There is a way}{}
\begin{stanza}
There is a way, a narrow way,\\
That leads to life above -\\
A way of peace and holiness,\\
Of purity and love.
\end{stanza}
\begin{chorus}
\setchorusline{My yearning soul desires to find}
My yearning soul desires to find\\
This hidden path of bliss;\\
Lord, hear my prayer, and lead me in\\
The way of holiness.
\end{chorus}
\begin{stanza}
To find this way, this living way,\\
We must forego our sin:\\
God has declared the pure in heart\\
Alone can enter in.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
There is a way, a humble way,\\
A way of truth and grace -\\
The highway of God's righteousness,\\
Where self can have no place.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
There is a way, a perfect way;\\
His chosen walk therein;\\
And they who share His suffering now\\
Eternal glory win.
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}

\begin{hymn}{54}{So kind a shepherd}{}
\begin{stanza}
Was there e'er so kind a Shepherd,\\
One so gentle yet so great,\\
As the Saviour, who would have us\\
Come and gather round His feet?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
There's a wideness in God's mercy,\\
Like the wideness of the sea;\\
There's a kindness in His justice,\\
Which is more than liberty.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
There is no place where earth's sorrows\\
Are more felt than up in heaven;\\
There is no place where earth's failings\\
Have such kindly judgment given.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
For the love of God is broader\\
Than the measure of man's mind,\\
And the heart of the Eternal\\
Is most wonderfully kind.
\end{stanza}
\end{hymn}
